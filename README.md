## JSON Data File

The plugin uses a JSON file to fetch music pieces. Ensure your JSON file includes all dates for the year 2024. Hereâ€™s an example format:

```json
{
    "2024-01-01": {
        "name": "Symphonic Ã‰tudes, op. 13",
        "author": "Schumann",
        "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIWBd7-AP4Q"
    },
    "2024-01-02": {
        "name": "Nocturnes",
        "author": "FaurÃ©",
        "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqw5B9B9j4M"
